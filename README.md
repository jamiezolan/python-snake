A simple Snake game with a hamster as the food!

# Snake n' Hamster Game Instructions:

## Objective:
Control the snake to eat the hamster, causing it to grow in length. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the screen's borders.

## Controls:

Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right): Move the snake in the corresponding direction.
Escape key: Quit the game.

## Gameplay:

The snake moves continuously in its current direction. Use the arrow keys to change its direction and guide it towards the hamster.
When the snake eats the hamster, it will grow in length, and a new hamster will appear at a random location on the screen.
The hamster will squeak when it's eaten by the snake.
The game will keep track of your score, which increases as the snake eats more hamsters.
If the snake collides with itself or the screen's borders, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message will be displayed.

On the splash screen, click "New Game" to start playing.

## Exiting the Game:

On the splash screen, click "Exit" to close the game.
