Throughout the process of making Snake n' Hamster, I learned various programming concepts and skills, including:

Pygame basics: I learned how to use the Pygame library to create a simple game, including initializing the library, creating a game window, handling user input, and updating the screen.

Game loop and timing: I learned the importance of a game loop in controlling the flow of the game and how to use a clock to manage the game's frame rate.

Custom game objects: I created custom classes for the snake and hamster, learning how to define their properties and behavior, such as movement and collision detection.

Game logic and collision detection: I implemented the game's core logic, including handling collisions between the snake and hamster, detecting when the snake collides with itself or the screen borders, and managing the game's score.

Drawing on the screen: I learned how to use Pygame's drawing functions to render the snake, hamster, and other game elements on the screen, as well as how to customize their appearance, such as colors and shapes.

Adding sound effects: I learned how to load and play sound files in Pygame to add a hamster squeak sound effect when the snake eats the hamster.

Implementing a splash screen: I created a splash screen with a "New Game" and "Exit" button, learning how to handle mouse input and create a simple menu system for my game.

Packaging and distributing my game: I learned how to use PyInstaller to package my game as a standalone executable, including its dependencies and assets, making it easy to distribute and share with others.

Debugging and problem-solving: Throughout the process, I encountered various issues and errors, learning how to identify the cause, apply solutions, and improve my code accordingly.
